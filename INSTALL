Running the honeypot

Before using the honeypot, make sure you update the signatures by running the following command. This may take a while!

#python honeypot.py update


=>Running the honeypot
#python honeypot.py --url www.yahoo.com
#python honeypot.py --file /opt/somefile-that-contains-a-list-of-suspecious-URLs.txt

for more information run:

#python honeypot.py --help

=>Running the honeypot with monitoring
#python honeypotMonitor --url www.yahoo.com
#python honeypotMonitor.py --file /opt/somefile-that-contains-a-list-of-suspecious-URLs.txt

HoneypotMonitor accepts the same argurements as the original honeypot.py

=>Report Generator Scripts (Inside scripts folder)
1) Extracts and appends connection refused links to connectionrefused.txt
#python extractconnectionrefuse.py sample.log

2) Extracts and appends forbidden links to forbidden.txt
#python extractforbidden.py sample.log

3) Extracts and appends redirection links to links.txt
#python redirectionlinks.py /home/user/yalih/debug /home/user/yalih/links.txt

4) Compares the differences between two log files
#python comparelog.py file1.log file2.log

=============================================================================
*** Scan log files are stored in the "scanlogs" folder.
*** you can get extra information about redirections, fobideen sites and error messages in the debug folder (debug files are stored based on the date and time of scan)
*** certain aspects of the honeyclient can be configure from the honeypotconfig.py file

Cheers
